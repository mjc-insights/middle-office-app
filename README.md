# Investment Operations & Analytics

**Streamline operations with AI-powered trade capture, exception management, and settlement readiness.**
**Built for asset managers and hedge funds.**

## What this app does
A Streamlit application that demonstrates a realistic middle-office workflow from trade capture through pre-settlement. Upload an OMS export to produce STP-ready outputs, flag rule-based exceptions, track lifecycle status, and prepare for T+1 affirmation.

## Key capabilities
- **Trade Capture & Data Quality Review**: Upload the OMS CSV, map required fields, and run presence, type, domain, and reference checks. The app writes **STP-ready** and **Exceptions** outputs only when a new OMS file is uploaded.  
- **Reference Data**: Security Master and Counterparty SSI lookups used by validation and exposure views.  
- **Enriched Positions & KPIs**: Portfolio stats (Market Value, Unrealized Gain/Loss and percent, day change percent), Exceptions view, and unsettled exposure by counterparty and by security.  
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Pending, Settled, and Failed derived from rule outcomes.  
- **Holiday Awareness**: U.S. weekend and holiday checks with a dedicated **DTC Settlement Holiday Schedule (2025)** page.  
- **Affirmation Readiness**: Countdown to the 9:00 pm ET target with an **On Track / At Risk / Breach** status chip.

## Pages
- **Overview & Help**: Intro, how it works, Quick Start, and shortcuts to core tabs.  
- **Upload & Review**: Internal positions file upload, light summaries, and moved settings for Break Thresholds and Day-over-Day comparisons.  
- **Trade Capture & Data Quality Review**: OMS upload, validations, and STP-ready vs Exceptions outputs.  
- **Validation Rules**: Catalog view driven by `validation_rules.yaml` with helper functions and status utilities.  
- **Reference Data**: Security Master and Counterparty SSI lookups to support validation and exposure views.  
- **Trade Lifecycle**: Status and exposure summaries by counterparty and by security.  
- **Post-Settlement**: Placeholder for future reconciliation to custodian records.  
- **DTC Settlement Holiday Schedule**: Clean 2025 schedule table.  
- **AI Assistant**: "Ops Co-pilot" chat that can use repo context to answer questions and surface metrics.

## Data inputs and outputs
**Inputs**
- OMS trade capture CSV (required)  
- Reference CSVs: `security_master` and `counterparty_ssi_brokers`

**Derived outputs**
- **STP-ready** trades and **Exceptions** table  
- Portfolio KPIs and unsettled exposure (grouped by counterparty and by security)  
- Day-over-day change metrics when market data enrichment is enabled

## Market-data enrichment
Optional enrichment via **Alpha Vantage**:
- Uses regular trading hours intraday bars during market hours.  
- After 4:00 pm ET, it first attempts the official daily close. If not yet published, it falls back to the 16:00 intraday bar.  
- Includes simple retry, throttling, and caching.  
> Set `ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY` in your environment to enable enrichment.

## AI Assistant (Ops Co-pilot)
- Repo-aware context so answers can cite or reason from project files when appropriate.  
- Lightweight intent router with generic tools and a data-dictionary builder for tables in session.  
- Bring-your-own OpenAI key in the sidebar field.  
> Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment to enable chat.

## Quick Start

### 1) Install
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


2) Configure environment
Create a .env file in the project root (or export in your shell):
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key

3) Run the app
streamlit run app.py


4) Use the workflow
‚¶Å	Open Upload & Review to load a sample or internal positions file if needed.
‚¶Å	Go to Trade Capture & Data Quality Review and upload your OMS CSV.
‚¶Å	Review Exceptions and STP-ready outputs.
‚¶Å	Explore Validation Rules, Reference Data, Trade Lifecycle, and DTC Settlement Holiday Schedule as needed.
‚¶Å	Run AI Assistant to ask questions grounded in your data.

Repo highlights
‚¶Å	app.py ‚Äî Navigation, BYO OpenAI key field in the sidebar, holiday schedule view, affirmation countdown and status chip, Upload & Review page, and day-over-day helpers.
‚¶Å	ui_pages.py ‚Äî Overview copy, hero subheads (‚ÄúStreamline operations‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuilt for asset managers and hedge funds‚Äù), and UI helpers for KPIs and exposure groupings.
‚¶Å	ai_assistant.py ‚Äî Repo-aware RAG index (FAISS), tiny router, generic tools, data-dictionary builder, streaming status, and OpenAI client.
